This is a machine learning classifier designed to detect malignant and benign tumors with 96% accuracy using the UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. Developed with scikit-learn and pandas, the model leverages a Random Forest classifier and applies preprocessing techniques such as standardized scaling and binary label encoding (B/M to 0/1) to enhance performance. To simulate real-world diagnostic scenarios, the system predicts outcomes on unseen patient data withheld during training, enabling automated risk assessment for early detection and medical decision support.
